# helloWorld
my first repo

Hello I am Finn. This file represents the first of many in my Github and initiates my journey towards building a useful influence in this world, as service to humanity. 

I am an 18 year old high school graduate. My first day at the switchMaven, Ikiago Dojo coding bootcamp is today, Monday, 5th of March , 2018. I am excited to get my brain into the work and scared to be living by myself for the first time, in a foreign country. 

I think I will be fine. 

-Finn
